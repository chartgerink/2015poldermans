# Analyzing DECREASE trials for extent of data fabrication

The DECREASE set of trials investigated the effectiveness of beta-blockers to prevent perioperative mortality in non-cardiac surgery. Perioperative stands for the period of the surgical procedure, typically including admission, anaesthesia, surgery, and recovery. Upon being discovered as unreliable (Commissie Vervolgonderzoek Wetenschap...; Commissie Vervolgonderzoek 2012 2012; Onderzoekscommissie Wetenschappelijke...), the DECREASE studies were excluded in a 2014 meta-analysis (Bouri et al. 2014), which found that conclusions with respect to the effectiveness of beta-blockers were reversed and increase perioperative mortality instead of decreasing it.

The reports into the DECREASE studies by the Erasmus University indicate that data fabrication was likely, but the extent of the data fabrication was not clearly indicated or deemed estimable. In this project, we aim to investigate the extent of data fabrication in the DECREASE studies by statistical analysis. We expect to confirm the conclusions of the reports that data fabrication is likely.
